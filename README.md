# Television-and-Testing
Good day once again to anyone who stumbled upon this code. Today, I bring you my latest code for a television as well as testing the program. It has the basic functions of a television such as:
- Changing the channel manually
- Changing the volume manually
- Scrolling through channels (from channels 1 to 120)
- Scrolling through volume (1 being the most quiet and 7 being the loudest)

With that said, I hope you like my code :)
